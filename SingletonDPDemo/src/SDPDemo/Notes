Singleton DP:
-> This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. 
-> This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class furthermore.

Example:

-> We're going to create a SingleObject class. SingleObject class have its constructor as private and have a static instance of itself.
-> SingleObject class provides a static method to get its static instance to outside world. SingletonPatternDemo, our demo class will use SingleObject class to get a SingleObject object.
