we have two sets, i.e., set1 = [22, 45, 33, 66, 55, 34, 77] and 
set2 = [33, 2, 83, 45, 3, 12, 55]. 
We can perform the following operation on the Set:

Intersection: 
	The intersection operation returns all those elements which are present 
	in both the set. 
	The intersection of set1 and set2 will be [33, 45, 55].
	
Union: 
	The union operation returns all the elements of set1 and set2 in a 
	single set, and that set
	 can either be set1 or set2. 
	 
	The union of set1 and set2 will be 
	[2, 3, 12, 22, 33, 34, 45, 55, 66, 77, 83].
	
Difference: 
	The difference operation deletes the values from the set which are 
	present in another set. 
	The difference of the set1 and set2 will be [66, 34, 22, 77].
	
	addAll() method is used to perform the union, 
	retainAll() method is used to perform the intersection and 
	removeAll() method is used to perform difference.
