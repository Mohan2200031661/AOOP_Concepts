/*Deep Object Cloning is like creating an exact copy of the original object by copying the fields from the original object to the cloned object. 
 * A separate memory is allocated for the cloned objects where the original object content is copied. 
 * clone() method can create both shallow and deep copy of the original object based on the implementation of it. 
 * Deep copy creates a new memory with the contents same as the original object.
 * Thatï¿½s why when we change the content of the original object after cloning, the changes do not reflect in the clone object. */

/*Types:
 * 1. LazyCopy - Combination of Both
 * 2. ShadowCopy - Same Moreover
 * 3. DeepCopy - Now Seeing
